## **1. Introduction**
## Problem Statement
The Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) at the Central University of Karnataka is responsible for ensuring continuous quality improvement in academic and administrative processes. However, traditional methods of managing committee operations, such as manual record-keeping, email communications, and paper-based documentation, present significant challenges. These include inefficiencies in report management, lack of centralized access to meeting minutes, and difficulties in tracking committee decisions over time.

The absence of a digital system leads to:

- Inefficient Documentation: Storing and retrieving meeting minutes is time-consuming and prone to data loss.
- Limited Accessibility: Committee members may struggle to access historical records and important documents when needed.
- Lack of Role-Based Control: Without proper user role management, unauthorized users may gain access to sensitive data, or legitimate users may lack the necessary permissions.
- Communication Gaps: Information sharing among committee members is fragmented, reducing transparency and accountability.
- Scalability Issues: As the committee expands, managing data manually becomes increasingly complex.

## **2. System Analysis**
The application is structured around multiple Vue.js components, each contributing to specific functionalities. These components interact with a backend API to ensure real-time data retrieval and management. The primary components include:

### **2.1 Committee-Members.vue**
- Displays a structured list of IQAC Committee members.
- Showcases details such as names, designations, roles, and profile images.
- Implements a responsive layout for seamless accessibility across devices.
- Enables real-time updates to maintain accurate information.

### **2.2 Navbar.vue**
- Provides essential navigation links, including "Home," "About Us," "IQAC," and "Reports."
- Features a responsive dropdown menu for easy access to multiple sections.
- Ensures a user-friendly browsing experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

### **2.3 MomReports.vue**
- Manages the display, download, and deletion of meeting reports.
- Integrates role-based access control, allowing only authorized users to delete files.
- Implements loading states and error handling to improve user experience.
- Fetches reports dynamically from the backend to ensure real-time updates.

### **2.4 Footer.vue**
- Includes links to external educational resources such as UGC, NAAC, and AICTE.
- Provides authentication controls, including login and logout options.
- Enhances usability by offering quick access to critical information.

These components collectively enhance the usability and effectiveness of the application, ensuring that IQAC Committee members can efficiently manage and access relevant information.

## **3. Methodology**
To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness, usability, and robustness of the IQAC Committee management application, a structured methodology was adopted. The assessment focused on technical architecture, user experience, data handling, security, and role-based access control mechanisms.

**Component Analysis:**

Each Vue.js component was examined in detail to assess its structure, functionality, and role within the application. The evaluation covered:

- **Code Efficiency:** Reviewing the logic behind each component to ensure optimal performance.
- **Interactivity:** Ensuring that Vue's reactive properties enhance user experience.
- **Data Binding and State Management:** Analyzing how data flows between components and how updates are reflected dynamically.
- **Reusability & Scalability:** Evaluating whether components can be modularly reused and scaled for future requirements.
- **Security and Access Control:** Assessing the implementation of role-based access control to ensure secure data
management.



- User Role Consideration 

User roles were a key focus in ensuring that access control policies were properly implemented. The application follows a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) approach, distinguishing between:

- **Admin Users:**

    Full control over the committee member list and reports.
Ability to delete reports (soft deletion).
Permission to modify the structure of the application if required.
- **Regular Users:**

    View-only access to reports and committee information.
Can download minutes of meetings but cannot delete or modify them.
This segregation ensures data security, prevents unauthorized modifications, and maintains transparency within the IQAC Committee.

**Data Fetching and Management**

Efficient data handling is crucial for a seamless user experience. The application follows a structured approach for data retrieval and storage:

**API Integration with Axios:**

Uses Axios to fetch meeting reports and committee member data from a backend API.
Ensures real-time updates and a dynamic user interface.
Handles errors gracefully with proper feedback mechanisms.
Database Schema & Soft Deletion:

The minutesofmeeting table maintains records with a status column (default 1 for active).
Instead of permanent deletion, records are marked as status = 0, ensuring data integrity and traceability.
Data Security & Storage Optimization:

Implements parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
Stores files as binary data (BLOB) in the database while maintaining metadata (e.g., file name, date, type).
Uses pagination and lazy loading to optimize performance when fetching large datasets.

**User Experience Evaluation**

A key objective of the evaluation was to ensure a smooth and user-friendly experience. The following aspects were assessed:

Navigation & Workflow Efficiency:

Tested the logical flow of user actions from login to report access.
Ensured the application remains intuitive, even for first-time users.
Responsiveness & Accessibility:

The application was tested on various screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
Employed accessibility best practices such as ARIA labels, color contrast, and keyboard navigability.
Performance & Load Handling:

Conducted stress testing to analyze application behavior under multiple concurrent users.
Optimized API calls to minimize response time.
Feedback & Error Handling:

Implemented meaningful error messages and loading indicators.
Ensured users receive clear guidance in case of failed operations (e.g., failed report fetch or deletion).
